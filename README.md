# Star Wars Info
## Using React + Redux + API
### Grabbing data from cloud-based API source
#### March 27 - April 12, 2018
#### Maker: [David Eliason](http://www.davethemaker.com)

### Goal:

Build react + redux infrastructure to display info.
Behind the scenes, grab data from API.
Front-end only for version one. 

### Learning Mission:

Working with cloud-based data is an important conceptual piece of a bigger project that I'm working on for Maker's Faire, called [IoT Empoering Me](http://www.mysticmonklabs.com/iotempoweringme) - an IoT + App product to empower individuals within the community.

- Version two will be for building a Native app.
- Version three will tie in back-end DB, possible routing using express and node.

### Practicuum:
